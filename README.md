# kata
Based on the Uncle Bob's books I'm going to excercise a bit, this repo is meant to keep the basic setup for the kata excercises.

# Sources

* Bowling Kata - the material for performing it is available [here](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

# Rules
* Don't rush it. It's important to memorize the steps to perform them on your own.
* When doing particular parts of kata do not start a new parts unless you master the current one.
* DO NOT CREATE separate branches - work only on main and perform `git reset` when the kata is done.
* Main branch contains basic project setup only.

All praise should go to the Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) and other propagators of programmers self-mastering.
